### Patch Changes

- 7ee992d: Fix broken external installs of the core plugins.

  Every core plugin emits a runtime `import { getPluginRegistry } from '@forumone/throughline-plugin-contract'`, but `plugin-contract` was marked `private` and never published — so the published plugins pinned `@forumone/throughline-plugin-contract: 0.0.0`, a version that does not exist on npm, and any external `pnpm install` failed with a 404.

  `plugin-contract` is now published, so the dependent plugins re-pin a real version. The cross-plugin registry is keyed on a global `Symbol.for(...)` and stored on the Payload instance, so behavior is unchanged.

  Also fixes the scaffolder, which pinned `@forumone/throughline-reference-ds@^0.1.0` (latest is `0.2.0`) in the generated `apps/web` and `design-system` packages.

### Minor Changes

- a4b5108: Initial release of the forms package. Wraps Payload's Form Builder plugin with the Throughline policy layer: mandatory privacy notice, consent enforcement (server-side), honeypot spam protection, Postgres-backed per-IP rate limiting, a destination allowlist (the security perimeter), and submitter confirmations. Six MCP tools (`list_allowed_destinations`, `validate_form`, `create_form`, `update_form_fields`, `update_form_destinations`, `get_form_submissions`) and four Inngest functions (`form-fan-out`, `form-email-destination`, `form-webhook-destination`, `form-submitter-confirmation`) drive the conversational flow and the async destination delivery. Includes `FormSubmissionEmail` and `SubmitterConfirmationEmail` React Email templates. Allowlist enforcement runs at three layers (MCP tool, collection beforeChange hook, fan-out worker) so prompt injection or admin direct-API writes can't bypass it. IPs are HMAC-hashed; raw IPs are never persisted. Adds `form.updated` to the core audit-action taxonomy used by the two update tools.
