## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 9131065: Three helpers that existed once per package now exist once
  - **`unwrapRelationshipId`** had four definitions — three private to `approvals`, one exported from `email` — differing only in a null guard that `typeof value === 'string'` already covers. One deliberate change comes with the move: none of the four handled a _numeric_ id, so on Postgres at `depth: 0` they returned `null` for a relationship that was populated fine. No caller reads at depth 0 today, so this fixes nothing and stops a shared helper being wrong for the first caller that does.
  - **`deniedEnvelope`** had three identical definitions, one per server with an access predicate. The role predicates stay where they are: what counts as an audit reader is not what counts as a forms author, and collapsing those would put one package's policy in another's file.
  - **The MCP handler rebuilt `createNamedLogger` inline**, forty lines from the real one in the same package.

  Nothing else in the duplication audit survived checking. `createFakePayload` has six definitions and three distinct implementations — a query engine, a two-line map read, and a stateful form store — which share a name and nothing else; merging them means building a fake that does all three jobs. `createFakeInngest` has one definition and three importers. The six MCP endpoint stanzas are real duplication that should be deleted rather than merged, once hosts move to `@payloadcms/plugin-mcp`.

### Minor Changes

- 1a4a441: Let every server's tools be served by Payload's own MCP plugin

  `createMcpToolCollector()` in core, and an `mcpTools` option on all six servers. The host hands the collector's array to `@payloadcms/plugin-mcp` at config time and each plugin fills it at `onInit` — which works because the plugin reads `mcp.tools` inside the handler it builds per request, so an array handed over empty is read populated.

  That ordering is the whole problem this solves: every tool in the suite is built at `onInit` because every one closes over `payload`, and `mcpPlugin` takes its tools as a config option.

  Omit `mcpTools` and nothing changes — each server keeps its own `/mcp` endpoint, which is what lets a host move one at a time rather than all six at once.

  Duplicate tool names are refused, naming both servers. Six servers each owning a `publish` was fine while each had its own endpoint; one server is one namespace, and an MCP client offered two tools under one name gets whichever registered last.

  **Also fixes a defect the integration test found.** `service.loadDocument` called `findByID` without `disableErrors`, so a missing document threw `NotFound` before the pipeline ran — which made the `exist` step's `not-found` branch unreachable from every caller, and turned "publish a document that does not exist" into a thrown error instead of the diagnostic the pipeline exists to return. The step's own tests passed it an empty document and so never noticed. `unpublish` now distinguishes a missing document from one that is merely already a draft.

### Patch Changes

- 7ee992d: Fix broken external installs of the core plugins.

  Every core plugin emits a runtime `import { getPluginRegistry } from '@forumone/throughline-plugin-contract'`, but `plugin-contract` was marked `private` and never published — so the published plugins pinned `@forumone/throughline-plugin-contract: 0.0.0`, a version that does not exist on npm, and any external `pnpm install` failed with a 404.

  `plugin-contract` is now published, so the dependent plugins re-pin a real version. The cross-plugin registry is keyed on a global `Symbol.for(...)` and stored on the Payload instance, so behavior is unchanged.

  Also fixes the scaffolder, which pinned `@forumone/throughline-reference-ds@^0.1.0` (latest is `0.2.0`) in the generated `apps/web` and `design-system` packages.

### Minor Changes

- 68cad81: Initial release of the audit query server. Five read-only MCP tools surface the audit log written by `@forumone/throughline-core`'s `auditPlugin`: `query_audit` (general filter), `get_change_history` (single-document history), `who_changed_what` (user activity, defaults to the caller), `what_changed_in_range` (grouped time-bounded summary), `get_recent_failures` (recent `success=false` events). Output is formatted for conversational use — relative times, named actors, prose summaries. Admin / editor gate by default, with `who_changed_what` always allowing self-lookup.
