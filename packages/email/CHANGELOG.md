### Patch Changes

- 957403b: One `@types/node`, so a host does not end up with two copies of `@payloadcms/ui`

  Twelve packages asked for `@types/node@^20.17.0` and `design-system-payload`
  asked for `^24.13.2`. Inside this repository that is untidy. Inside a host that
  consumes the suite from source — which is how `forumone/forumone-2026` uses it,
  as a git submodule in one pnpm workspace — it is a runtime failure.

  pnpm hashes a package's identity with its resolved peers. `publishing` and
  `integrations` both take `@payloadcms/ui` as a peer _and_ as a devDependency, so
  each got its own copy resolved against `@types/node@20`, while the host's copy
  resolved against `@types/node@24`. Same version, 3.87.1, two directories:

      apps/web                     → @payloadcms+ui@3.87.1_…_9ce0de5c…
      packages/publishing          → @payloadcms+ui@3.87.1_…_13184ec4…
      packages/integrations        → @payloadcms+ui@3.87.1_…_13184ec4…

  Two directories are two module instances. Two instances of `@payloadcms/ui` are
  two `ConfigContext` objects, and `PublishButton` read the one the admin's
  provider had never populated:

      TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'config' of useConfig() as it is undefined

  The host saw an intermittent 500 on every admin document view — `PublishButton`
  is installed on each collection with a publish policy, so lists, `/admin` and
  the login screen were all fine and only editing broke. Nothing caught it:
  install, `--frozen-lockfile`, typecheck, lint and every test passed, because the
  two copies are byte-identical and the split exists only at module resolution.
  forumone/forumone-2026#498.

  Aligning on `^24.13.2` collapses them to one instance. Nothing here targets a
  Node 20 API deliberately; the packages typecheck and test unchanged against the
  newer types.

  `create-throughline` keeps `^20.17.0` on purpose. It is the one package
  declaring `engines.node: >=20.9.0`, and typechecking a CLI against types newer
  than the runtime it promises to support is how a Node 24-only call ships to
  somebody on Node 20.

### Patch Changes

- 9131065: Three helpers that existed once per package now exist once
  - **`unwrapRelationshipId`** had four definitions — three private to `approvals`, one exported from `email` — differing only in a null guard that `typeof value === 'string'` already covers. One deliberate change comes with the move: none of the four handled a _numeric_ id, so on Postgres at `depth: 0` they returned `null` for a relationship that was populated fine. No caller reads at depth 0 today, so this fixes nothing and stops a shared helper being wrong for the first caller that does.
  - **`deniedEnvelope`** had three identical definitions, one per server with an access predicate. The role predicates stay where they are: what counts as an audit reader is not what counts as a forms author, and collapsing those would put one package's policy in another's file.
  - **The MCP handler rebuilt `createNamedLogger` inline**, forty lines from the real one in the same package.

  Nothing else in the duplication audit survived checking. `createFakePayload` has six definitions and three distinct implementations — a query engine, a two-line map read, and a stateful form store — which share a name and nothing else; merging them means building a fake that does all three jobs. `createFakeInngest` has one definition and three importers. The six MCP endpoint stanzas are real duplication that should be deleted rather than merged, once hosts move to `@payloadcms/plugin-mcp`.

### Patch Changes

- 7ee992d: Fix broken external installs of the core plugins.

  Every core plugin emits a runtime `import { getPluginRegistry } from '@forumone/throughline-plugin-contract'`, but `plugin-contract` was marked `private` and never published — so the published plugins pinned `@forumone/throughline-plugin-contract: 0.0.0`, a version that does not exist on npm, and any external `pnpm install` failed with a 404.

  `plugin-contract` is now published, so the dependent plugins re-pin a real version. The cross-plugin registry is keyed on a global `Symbol.for(...)` and stored on the Payload instance, so behavior is unchanged.

  Also fixes the scaffolder, which pinned `@forumone/throughline-reference-ds@^0.1.0` (latest is `0.2.0`) in the generated `apps/web` and `design-system` packages.

### Minor Changes

- fab82fc: Initial release of the email package. Pairs Resend with React Email templates and ships the three notification Inngest functions that close the approval workflow loop. Templates: `ApprovalRequestEmail` (preview + Approve / Request changes / Discuss), `ApprovalDecisionEmail` (granted / declined / changes-requested variants with decision-aware next-step copy), `ApprovalExpiredEmail`. All render to HTML and plaintext from the same React tree. Functions: `createNotifyApprovalRequestFunction` (subscribes to `notification/send-approval-request`, sends per approver in `notifiedApprovers` with each in its own `step.run`), `createNotifyApprovalDecisionFunction` (subscribes to `notification/send-approval-decision`), `createNotifyApprovalExpiredFunction` (subscribes to `approval/expired`). Themed via `EmailBrandTokens` (neutral defaults; brand name lands in header / From name / footer for consistency). Plugin exposes the client and functions via Symbols (`getEmailClient`, `getEmailFunctions`) for the client app's Inngest endpoint to compose. Throws at init if `RESEND_API_KEY` / `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` / `resolveApprover` / `resolveRequester` / `buildActionUrl` are missing.
