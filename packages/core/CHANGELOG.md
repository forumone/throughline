### Minor Changes

- [#14](https://github.com/forumone/throughline/pull/14) [`5329d97`](https://github.com/forumone/throughline/commit/5329d97363099a54bcae2516a8aa9eff8cd735fc) Thanks [@briangraves](https://github.com/briangraves)! - Initial release. Provides the audit log (collection + fire-and-forget writer + plugin), MCP authentication (bearer-token authenticator + API-keys collection with SHA-256 hashed keys), event taxonomy and Inngest client factory, MCP handler infrastructure (JSON-RPC over HTTP) with the `_meta` helper for prompt/reasoning capture, standard env-var conventions, a default logger, and shared utilities. Every server package in the framework depends on this.
